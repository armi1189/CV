## Andrea Armiliato

I'm an enthusiastic italian guy who loves good food and coding. I've developed my passion during my early years but I've never went deep into it until my University years. I'm looking for a job placement that makes me fell at home and gives me the opportunity to learn more and improve my skills.

## Skills

#### Coding

Been into coding since I was 10, self-taught until the age of 25 when I've decided to enroll at Makers Accademy, I define myself a really enthusiastic learner and a great problem solver.  
During my expirence I had the oportunity to learn plenty of stuff, starting from work methodologies, such as TDD and pair programming, and ending with languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, with some of their relative frameworks. But most important i've learned how to properly learn by myself and i've all the instruments that I need to understand a new language from scratch and feel comfortable with it.

There are some of the projects i've done during my twelve weeks adventure at Makers Accademy:

- [Ignite](https://github.com/IgniteIt/ignite_it)
- [InstagApp](https://github.com/armi1189/instagram-challenge)
- [ToDoList](https://github.com/armi1189/todo_challenge)
- [BowlingScoreCalculator](https://github.com/armi1189/bowling-challenge)
- [Thermostat](https://github.com/armi1189/Thermostat_Interface)
- [RockPaperScissors](https://github.com/armi1189/rps-challenge)
   

#### Sound Engeneereng

I've worked as freelance sound engeneereng in my previous life. No more insterested in that job because i wanted to complete my stuides and do something different with my life. By the way i still have good knowledge of sound manipolation software such as Logic Pro and CuBase, and good knowledge of recording techniques, mixing and instrumentation.
