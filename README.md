## Andrea Armiliato

I am an enthusiastic italian guy who loves good food and coding. I've developed my passion during my early years but I never covered it deeply until my time at University. I am currently looking for a job placement that makes me feel at home and gives me the opportunity to learn more and improve my skills.

## Skills

#### Coding

I have been a completely self-taught coder until the age of 25, where upon I decided to enroll at Makers Accademy, I define myself as a really enthusiastic learner and a great problem solver.  
During my expirence I had the oportunity to learn many thing, including work methodologies, such as TDD and pair programming, and programming languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, and their relative frameworks. More importantly, I have learnt how to properly teach myself and i have developed all the necessary techniques that I need to understand a new language from scratch and feel comfortable with it.

There are some of the projects i've done during my twelve weeks adventure at Makers Accademy:

- [Ignite](https://github.com/IgniteIt/ignite_it)
- [InstagApp](https://github.com/armi1189/instagram-challenge)
- [ToDoList](https://github.com/armi1189/todo_challenge)
- [BowlingScoreCalculator](https://github.com/armi1189/bowling-challenge)
- [Thermostat](https://github.com/armi1189/Thermostat_Interface)
- [RockPaperScissors](https://github.com/armi1189/rps-challenge)
   

#### Sound Engeneereng

I have worked as freelance sound engineer before pursuing programming. I am no longer insterested in that job because i wanted to complete my studies and do something more fulfilling.  I still have good knowledge of sound manipulation software such as Logic Pro and CuBase, and good knowledge of recording techniques, mixing and instrumentation.
